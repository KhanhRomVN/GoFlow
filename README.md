```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Settings

Access via VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`):

```json
{
  "copyPathWithCode.enableClipboardDetection": true,
  "copyPathWithCode.enableTempStorage": true,
  "copyPathWithCode.tempStorageCleanupDays": 7,
  "copyPathWithCode.showFileCount": true,
  "copyPathWithCode.searchCaseSensitive": false,
  "copyPathWithCode.searchIncludeExtensions": true
}
```

## üìñ Detailed Usage Guide

### Creating and Managing Folders

1. **Open Code Folders View**: Click the folder icon in the activity bar
2. **Create New Folder**: Click the + button in the view title bar
3. **Add Files**: Right-click folder ‚Üí "Add Files to Folder"
4. **Organize**: Use drag-to-select or shift-click for multiple files

### Advanced Clipboard Techniques

```typescript
// Example: Multi-file workflow for documentation
const workflow = {
  step1: "Copy several related files using Ctrl+Alt+C",
  step2: "Save to temporary storage with Ctrl+Alt+Q",
  step3: "Switch to different workspace or project",
  step4: "Restore clipboard contents when needed",
  step5: "Paste all files as formatted markdown",
};
```

### Search and Discovery

- Use `Ctrl+Alt+F` in folder view to search across all files
- Filter by file name, extension, or content type
- Search results show match counts and quick navigation

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Performance Optimization

For large codebases (1000+ files):

- Enable "searchIncludeExtensions" to filter by file type
- Use workspace-specific folders instead of global view
- Clear temporary storage periodically

### Clipboard Detection Issues

If automatic detection isn't working:

1. Check `copyPathWithCode.enableClipboardDetection` setting
2. Verify clipboard content format matches expected patterns
3. Check extension logs via "Show Extension Logs" command

### File Organization Tips

- Use descriptive folder names for better searchability
- Leverage the multi-select interface for batch operations
- Utilize different workspaces for separate project contexts

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Cross-Workspace File Handling

The extension intelligently handles files across different VS Code workspaces, providing visual indicators and maintaining relative paths where possible.

### Customizable Themes

The extension respects VS Code theme colors and provides additional color customization points for:

- Different workspace indicators
- Search highlights
- Status bar elements
- Folder hierarchy visual cues

### Extension API Integration

While primarily a UI extension, it integrates deeply with VS Code's:

- File system providers
- Clipboard APIs
- Workspace management
- Editor selection context

## üìä Performance Characteristics

| Operation           | Typical Speed | Large Project Impact  |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| File Copy           | Instant       | Minimal               |
| Folder Creation     | <100ms        | Low                   |
| Search Filtering    | <50ms         | Medium (with caching) |
| Clipboard Detection | <200ms        | Low                   |
